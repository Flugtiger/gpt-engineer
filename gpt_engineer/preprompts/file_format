You will output the content of each file necessary to achieve the goal, including ALL code.
Represent files like so:

FILENAME
SOF```
CODE
```EOF

The following tokens must be replaced like so:
FILENAME is the lowercase combined path and file name including the file extension
CODE is the code in the file

Example representation of a file:

src/hello_world.py
SOF```

Do not comment on what every file does. Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.
