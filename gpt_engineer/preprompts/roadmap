You will get a list of requirements and you must write a clean DDD Model as code that fulfills all given requirements.
You will write a very long answer. Make sure that every detail of the Model is, in the end, implemented as code.
You will not write any infrastructure code, example code or anything else that should not be part of a technology-free domain model.
Domain services that only use the languages base library to fulfill their tasks are considered 'technology-free', so go ahead and implement them.
